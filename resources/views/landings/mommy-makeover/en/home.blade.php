                        Breast lifting and enlargement are among the procedures called "momommy makeover turkey istanbul". Especially during the breastfeeding period, the breasts filled with milk start to shrink and sag after the breastfeeding period. Breasts are lifted and enlarged with the use of prosthetic silicones. Excess fat and skin in the abdominal area are removed with a tummy tuck operation. Thus, the abdominal area, which has reached the desired form, is tightened.

                    <p>
                        Liposuction treatment is also included in maternity aesthetics. Localized fat and fat in general are eliminated with this method.

Thanks to maternity aesthetics, the inner lips are reduced and the vagina regains its former appearance. Mommy makeover prices are determined according to the scope of the package to be purchased.

                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        The body types and problems experienced by patients who decide to have a mommy makeover are different from each other. While some women prefer a few procedures in the form of a package, some women prefer regional aesthetics.
                        <br><br>
                        Maternity aesthetics include breast lifting, augmentation of small breasts, removing excess fat from women with large breasts, abdominal lifting, liposuction, etc. During aesthetic procedures, patients are anesthetized in the operating room with general anesthesia. The price of maternity aesthetics varies depending on the procedure preferred by the patient.    </p>

                    <h2> Post-Surgery Process

                    </h2>
                    <p>The recovery time varies depending on the operations performed. After the aesthetic procedures, the patients are followed up in hospital for a certain period of time and then discharged. Therefore, patients should have a quality rest after the mommy makeover. They should use the special bras and corsets given by the doctor on a regular basis. Patients who have had abdominoplasty should avoid sudden movements for a certain period of time. Rest and regular use of the cream and medicines given by the doctor is important for the stitches to conglutinate.

                        <h2>What Should Patients Take Care of After "Mommy Makeover Turkey Istanbul"</h2>
                        <p>
                            Patients should be physically active to maximum extent after mommy lifting procedures.
                            The longer patients walk without tiring themselves, the faster postoperative recovery is.
                            Lower consumption of sugar and salt after the surgery will ensure quicker regression of edema.

                            Since patients are undergone abdominoplasty, they should not carry or lift heavy objects for 6 weeks.
                            Patients, who undergo breast surgery, are recommended not to raise their arms too much for 6 weeks.
                        </p>
                        <h2>How About Postoperative Recovery Period?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Patients should start walking immediately after mommy makeover. Although mobilization will be difficult
                            for several days due to drains, it is so crucial to walk in this period.
                        </p>
