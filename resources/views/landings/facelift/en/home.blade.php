                        The Face Lift surgery ensures a youthful face and a fresher appearance. Face lift surgery is especially applied in patients with increased sagging in the jaw line and deepening of the fold, which we call the nasolabial fold, between the cheek and lips.

                    <h2>Differences Between Face Lift Surgeries</h2>
                    <p>
                       <b> Mini Face Lift:</b> It is performed to correct sagging in the lower jaw line and jowl area (in the lower face area). The incision line starts in front of the ear and turns under the earlobe towards the back of the ear.
                        <br><br>
                     <b>Full facelift: </b>   this technique is an extended version of mini facelift. In addition to the benefits of the Mini facelift procedure, the temples, eye corners and eyebrows are lifted as well with this operation. Cheeks and cheekbones are more effectively lifted in the Full Facelift surgery compared to the Mini Facelift surgery. In a full facelift, the incision starts from the scalp in the temporal region, and continues downwards as a mini facelift.
                        As a result, patients' faces are aimed to look decades younger than their biological age.

                    </p>

                    <h3>Deep Plane Facelift</h3>
<p>Facelift surgery is not a skin lift alone. In every kind of Facelift surgery, soft tissue under the skin named SMAS has to be lifted as well. There are a few techniques in lifting the SMAS tissue. The SMAS lift, SMASectomy, and the deep plane SMAS lift are some of the techniques used in lifting the SMAS tissue. In the deep plane SMAS surgery, the results are more affective and long-termed.</p>

                        <h2>Post-Surgery Process</h2>
                        <p>
                            After the facelift procedure, the patients are followed up in hospital for a certain period and then discharged. After discharge, the routine medications are given to the patients and their incision care and dressings are done by our clinicâ€™s nurses at the 5-star hotel. Therefore, we ensure that our patients should have a quality rest after the facelift surgery. They should use the special garments clothed a few days after their surgery by the nurses of the clinic on a regular basis for 3 weeks. After the discharge, patients are transferred in VIP transportation to the doctorâ€™s clinic from the hotel for the doctorâ€™s personal check up.
                        </p>
                        <h2>What Should Patients Do During Recovery After Facelift Surgery?</h2>
                        <p>After the surgery, the patients need to take the medications given by the doctor. The doctor will give the information on the duration of the garmentsâ€™ usage. The necessary dressings materials will be given to the patient before their return to their home country. The patient is informed of their personal aftercare.</p>
                        <h2>The Price of the Facelift Surgery in Turkey</h2>
                        <p>The prices can change depending on the type of the facelift procedures (Fullface, Mini Facelift), the patientâ€™s previous surgeries, and the diseases the patient has. You can achievea youthful face with a budget friendly cost, that includes an experienced surgeon, surgery in an A+ hospital, 5-star hotel accommodation, VIP transportation, and nurse care. For an accurate price, please contact us.</p>
