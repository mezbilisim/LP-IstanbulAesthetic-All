With the bodytite technique I use while removing fat, I make the chest muscle shadow (in suitable patients) become noticeable. In this way, more athletic and masculine results appear after the operation.  In glandular type enlargement (ie in people with enlarged breast tissue), it is important to remove the gland tissues with a half-moon incision. Otherwise, the gynecomastia problem carries the risk of recurrence after 5-6 years. The vast majority of these patients are those who are tried to be treated only with liposuction. As a surgeon who deals between 10 and 20 gynecomastia cases per month, my preference is to combine both methods. In other words, an incision of 4-5 millimeters is made in a part close to the armpit.

It is very important to ideally shape the area with the technique of removing gland tissues without damaging the muscles and then vaser liposuction. As a result, it should not be forgotten that it is an aesthetic operation. So the first point is to research a good plastic surgeon. The second important point is to question how often the plastic surgeon you have received information from performs this operation and the satisfaction rate. Third, of course, it is very important that you receive service in a good hospital. A fully-fledged, state-of-the-art operating room is very important."],

Getting cosmetic surgery abroad is a scary thought, and with all the advertising and offers, it is difficult to know who to trust. I had contacted hundreds of doctors and clinics but was fortunate to talk to a lady who recommended Doc Dr Daghan Isik. He is so welcoming, friendly, and professional. Not only ask but listen and be honest and upfront with what can be safely achieved. It was heartwarming when he asked for my parents' number so he could update them during the surgery of how it was going and the stages they were at. So considerate of him. In addition to all these doctors' fantastic qualities and skills is a remarkable lady ... The Angel by his side Nurse Nazli. So professional, supportive and compared to other clinics and services she knows the best things to do in any eventuality and provides a solution to every problem and an answer to every question you may have. Part of the reason for getting this surgery was to love my body again. It was so hard to even look at it myself, let alone let anyone see me with no clothes on. She made this so much easier. Highly recommend! Be treated like an individual with their own cosmetic goals instead of a number on a target board. Thank you for making mine and my families week so much easier.
