Getting cosmetic surgery abroad is a scary thought, and with all the advertising and offers, it is difficult to know who to trust. I had contacted hundreds of doctors and clinics but was fortunate to talk to a lady who recommended Doc Dr Daghan Isik. He is so welcoming, friendly, and professional. Not only ask but listen and be honest and upfront with what can be safely achieved. It was heartwarming when he asked for my parents' number so he could update them during the surgery of how it was going and the stages they were at. So considerate of him. In addition to all these doctors' fantastic qualities and skills is a remarkable lady ... The Angel by his side Nurse Nazli. So professional, supportive and compared to other clinics and services she knows the best things to do in any eventuality and provides a solution to every problem and an answer to every question you may have. Part of the reason for getting this surgery was to love my body again. It was so hard to even look at it myself, let alone let anyone see me with no clothes on. She made this so much easier. Highly recommend! Be treated like an individual with their own cosmetic goals instead of a number on a target board. Thank you for making mine and my families week so much easier.
